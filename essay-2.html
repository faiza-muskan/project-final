          Legibility is relative. Is it time we broke the tablets of stone?
        </h1>

        <h3>Agenda by Michèle-Anne Dauppe</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Traditionally, legibility has been determined by a set of fixed
          criteria, absolute standards based on optical research: the “rules” of
          typography. But this approach denies the cultural connotations of
          type. Typefaces and typography communicate meanings and target their
          audience by class, age and gender. Neville Brody’s early reductions of
          words to signs in <em>The Face</em> magazine, for example, knew and
          found their audience. Legibility cannot be a blanket evaluation; it
          must take account of whether the target audience gets the message.
          Moreover, the concept of legibility itself raises the question:
          legible by whom?<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Legibility must also be considered within the framework of history:
          standards may shift according to the period of history under
          consideration. Baskerville is perhaps the epitome of a legible
          typeface, embodying the traditional virtues of a classic. But when
          first introduced in 1757, Baskerville was heavily criticised for its
          illegibility – for being “fatiguing to the eye”, and indeed for
          “blinding the Nation” with “Baskerville pains”. The root of this
          supposed illegibility was the fineness of Baskerville’s serifs, made
          possible by improvements in printing and paper surfaces. Times change:
          what is readable now may well have been completely unreadable in the
          past. We live in the age of television, with a visually literate
          audience used to a sophisticated level of coding and pace. The
          audience has moved on, the technology has moved on, but the attitudes
          of some typographers have not. They prefer to jealousy guard their
          rules – their tablets of stone – rather than confront the complex
          shifting ground of legibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The contemporary interest in pushing typography to the boundaries of
          legibility is part of a broader cultural context – the post-modern
          condition. Challenging functionalism in typography has led to
          experimentation with the message rather than words, with type as
          image, with recognition rather than reading. The work of British
          typographers such as Phil Baines, Jon Barnbrook and Brody challenges
          accepted dogmas, some of which stem from the legacy of modernism.
          Modernism itself was truly radical (consider Bayer, Zwart, El
          Lissitsky), but its inheritors allowed it to become impoverished and
          sterile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way of understanding this typography is to consider it in
          relation to other radical approaches to communication. There is a
          history of work which aims to disrupt “the flow” (Brechtian theatre,
          for example). This political stance attempted to engage the audience
          with the text, to make the audience “work”, and to emphasise the
          “construction” of meaning. Radical typography might aim, not to flow
          seamlessly, legibly, but to halt and disrupt, to expose meaning and
          language as problematic.
        </p>
        <p>
          A radical aesthetic is neither style nor a set of devices to employ.
          Its appropriateness will vary according to the historical context.
          Cultural debates from earlier this century, such as Brecht’s theory of
          “alienation” and the Russian Formalists’ theory of “making strange”
          cannot be naively transported to the present, but they do form a
          history of theory and practice on which to draw in developing the
          debate on legibility in a cultural context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continuing theoretical revelations of recent decades in semiology,
          structuralism and psychoanalysis have deep implications for
          contemporary typography, given typography’s special relationship with
          language. So why is typography so under-theorised? Part of the problem
          is the weighty millstone of “craft” blocking intellectual enquiry.
          Technology, for example, has a crucial role in contemporary
          typography. Apple Macintoshes have facilitated the development of
          radical approaches to legibility in typography. The exploding visual
          and creative freedom which the Macintosh makes possible is
          unparalleled. With increased experimentation, a new vocabulary for
          typographic design could evolve, freed from the constraints of
          tradition. But this potential is consistently denied by the British
          typographic establishment, who insist on restricting the argument
          about the limits of legibility to one about craft. Anti-Macintosh
          propaganda on the grounds of loss of craft skills and appreciation
          obscures the real impact of technology. Why is it so tenaciously
          upheld? Protectionism. Technology smashes vested interests. The whole
          guild-like conspiracy of typographer/typesetter/printer is being
          usurped by the Macintosh – when under threat, raise high the “craft”
          banner.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the debate over legibility is diverted into one about craft instead
          of communication. Why should this matter? It matters because it is
          part of an ideology which says that legibility is scientific, that
          rules transcend history and that type is neutral. Type is not neutral.
          The values and messages it communicates are available for
          appropriation – they are not fixed. Typography can legitimise or
          trivialise, confirm or reject: it has effect. Typography is powerful
          and typographers should wake up to their responsibilities;
          responsibility, not at the obvious level of aesthetics (cosy
          typography), but social responsibility. Typography is part of
          everyone’s physical environment. It is omnipresent and, crucially, it
          carries the irrefutable authority of print. The cry of “legibility”
          masks a reactionary attitude against progress, change or critical
          intervention. Meaningful critical debate can only proceed if we
          disentangle typography from craft and establish its role within
          culture.
